  - **Libraries**: 
    - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
    - Seaborn (for advanced visualizations)
    - Pandas (for data manipulation)
    - NLTK/TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- **SQL**: For data storage, aggregation, and querying
- **Tableau**: For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Clean and standardize YouTube trending datasets from different countries.
   - Remove irrelevant or missing data, and handle discrepancies in formats.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the **titles** and **tags** of the videos using Python libraries like NLTK or TextBlob.
   - Categorize the sentiment into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** sentiments for further analysis.
